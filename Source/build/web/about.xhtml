                                    <p>Our philosophy's pretty simple: we don't take fashion or life too seriously.</p>
                                    <p>From over 4 million fans on social and an online magazine, we're the dress you need at the weekend, and the moments you need when you're down.</p>
                                    <h2>OUR CHARITY STRATEGY</h2>
                                    <p>We all know that it's better to give than to receive, that's why we've set up Fashion Man's charity program to raise money and awareness for causes close to our hearts.</p>-->
